Trying to get a hide and show toggle function for an array

In June 2011, PEPFAR (under the leadership of OGAC) and the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS launched a global plan to virtually eliminate mother-to-child transmission of HIV with the goal of reducing new HIV infections in children by 90% by 2015
2011 -  57% of HIV-infected pregnant women in low- and middle-income countries received a World Health Organization (WHO)â€“recommended regimen for prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT)
an estimated 300,000 infants acquired HIV infection from their mothers in sub-Saharan Africa
15,700 (5.2%) of these infants were born in Malawi
At the end of 2011, the Malawi Ministry of Health (MOH) implemented an innovative approach (called "Option B+"), in which all HIV-infected pregnant and breastfeeding women are eligible for lifelong antiretroviral therapy (ART)
Will get final number and implement in this interactive (see idea below)

Similar to the Washington Post graphic, do a picture that represents infants in pacifiers and you can toggle between
: All babies born each year in malawi,
, percentage of babies that would be transmitted AIDS by their mother without care
, percentage of babies that would be transmitted AIDS by their mother with care.
